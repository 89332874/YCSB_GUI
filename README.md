YCSB_GUI
========

This project is a simple tool for translating YCSB results to charts. Basically, it converts the output files to corresponding representation in JSON and uses Highcharts library, which is an open-source JS library, to show them as a series of charts. The current implementation is in PHP and receives the output of the modified version of YCSB available at https://github.com/samanca/YCSB.
